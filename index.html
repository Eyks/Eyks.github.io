<p> <div class="a"> Hi guys, my name is Skye, and this is my simple webpage. I
  grew up in Kennebunkport, Maine, and I've lived in NYC previously. Now,
I go to school here in Orono. </div> I entered school as a CS Major, but quickly found out it wasn't the path for me, so I switched to
Economics. Along the way, I picked up Accounting and decided I would like to become a CPA. <div class="a">
  Now, I am taking the required business classes, as well as Master's Economics courses. I will
  graduate in Spring 2020 with a double major BS in Economics & Accounting, along with the 150 required credits for the
  CPA exam!
